- [x] Grid-based A* pathfinding 
- [x] Visual path debugging in editor (EasyPathDebugWindow) 
- [x] Custom inspectors for Grid and Agent 
- [x] Full source code with assembly definitions 
- [x] Demo scene generation (Basic, Multi-Agent, Stress Test) 
- [x] Click-to-move, obstacle spawning, multi-agent controls 
- [ ] Documentation 
- [ ] Unit tests 
 
## Option 2: SwarmAI ← NEXT PROJECT
**Multi-agent coordination (like Battlecode rats)** 
 
- Price: $45 
- Target: RTS/colony sim developers 
- Complexity: Medium-High (3-4 weeks)

- [x] Assembly definitions configured
- [x] SwarmManager singleton
- [x] SwarmAgent component
- [x] State machine system (Idle, Moving, Seeking, Fleeing)
- [x] Spatial partitioning (SpatialHash)
- [x] Inter-agent messaging (SwarmMessage)
- [ ] Steering behaviors (Seek, Flee, Flock, etc.)
- [ ] Formation system
- [ ] Demo scenes
- [ ] Documentation 
 
## Option 3: NPCBrain 
**All-in-one AI toolkit** 
 
- Price: $60 
- Target: Intermediate developers 
- Complexity: High (4-6 weeks) 
- Combines pathfinding + behaviors + sensing 
 
## Recommendation 
~~Start with EasyPath - lowest complexity, clear market demand.~~ 
 
**UPDATE:** EasyPath is working! Pathfinding tested and functional. 
Demo scenes available via EasyPath menu. Multi-agent support working. 
Next: Write documentation, add unit tests, prepare for Asset Store submission.
